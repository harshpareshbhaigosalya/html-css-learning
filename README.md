## 💡 Best Practices & Tips

* Use semantic HTML (e.g. `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`)
* Avoid overusing `!important`
* Mobile‑first CSS (start styling for small viewport, scale up)
* Use shorthand CSS properties where possible
* Keep CSS modular (separate into logical files)
* Test on multiple browsers / devices
* Use comments liberally in snippets to explain “why”
